The materials are split into 2 folders: `BIAS edited files` and `wireshark files`.

## BIAS edited files

This folder contains 2 JSON files that are the impersonation files for a Pixel 3a phone and a WH-CH510 headset. The file's structure is based off of the code from https://github.com/francozappa/bias/tree/master/bias but all of the values inside we gathered ourselves.

The Python files are only slightly edited by us to change them from Python 2 to Python 3. `bias-Pixel3a.py` and `bias-WHCH510.py` were generated by the edited `generate.py`, which uses the `bias-template.py` to create them.

The `Makefile` was edited to build the Python files with Python 3 instead of Python 2, and there are 2 commands to patch the attack device to either the Pixel 3a or the WH-CH10.

## wireshark files

On the first level it contains the PCAP files used as examples in the paper. `A` stands for Attacker, which is the same as CYW in the naming.

In the `failed wiresharks` folder are the other PCAP files that did not end up in the paper. They are here to show a few of the recorded failed BIAS attempts.
